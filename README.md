# Movie-data-analysis-
This is a Personal project carried out during my second semester exam.
It gives a detailed analysis of IMDB movie dataset downloaded from kaggle. It gives information on the top movie genres based on gross earnings and movie ratings.

Note: For this project, I represented my imaginary company as MMDB.

The primary objective of this project was to leverage data analysis techniques to recommend the most profitable movie genres for production. By diving into the dataset, I sought to uncover insights that would guide decisions on genre selection, thereby enhancing the likelihood of financial success.

For the data cleaning process, I used the Excel's Power Query Editor. This involved addressing missing values, standardizing data formats, and resolving any inconsistencies to ensure the accuracy of subsequent analyses. I also used Excel to create my dashboards for the visualizations. PowerPoint was used to give a detailed report on the analysis carried out.

Through the meticulous analysis of the movie dataset, I was able to successfully identify the top three movie genres that offer the greatest potential for profit maximization. The results were backed by data-driven insights that considered both financial performance and audience preferences.
